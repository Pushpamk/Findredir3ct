## This is Simple Open redirection vulnerability Finder 

## Don't Know about open redirect vulnerability ?
Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts may have a more trustworthy appearance. Unvalidated redirect and forward attacks can also be used to maliciously craft a URL that would pass the applicationâ€™s access control check and then forward the attacker to privileged functions that they would normally not be able to access.
